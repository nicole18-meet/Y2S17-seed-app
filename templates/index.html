 <div class="name">Carlos Hawari </div> <br> My name is Carlos, I was born in Nazareth,Israel and I am a student in MEET.<br>
I'm very passionate about this project and really hope to see it succeed, the main reason for that is because I truly believe it is important for us to raise awarness about these diseases and hopefully minimize the damage these diseases are currently inflicting on alot of people in our world.

Our aim from this project is to raise people's knowledge about some of the most popular diseases our world is facing these days. I think that this is something essencial because using this website can help people know if they have any health problems, further more, they will know how to prevent some diseases. They will also gain some really omportant information, which will raise the community's awareness. </div></div>

<br> I want this webapp to work out because I think it's gonna help a lot with sharing awareness, and also help people interersted in medicin and health get more information about what diseases we are facing and how to prevent them (if possible).
<br>
In order to develop this webapp, I built a bit on the main idea, took part in making the webapp and helped with the design.

Their life consist different elements which mostly make everyday routine harder.<br> In my opinion, whether it is for educational purposes or just to know what people around us go through, each person must try our platform. </div></div>
