<p class="text1"> After choosing a disease, you will get the chance to live through a day with it (without actually having it of course), in order to feel what a real patient goes through on a daily basis. <br>
During the day, you will receive notifications of tasks that need to be done if you were actually suffering from this medical condition. In order to get through the tasks, you will have to press "done" on each one of them. <br>
The second a notification has been sent to you, you get a limited amount of time to complete it (press "done"), just like real patients who need to keep track on times.<br>
If the "done" button was not pressed and the time passed, the task will be considered as not completed.<br>
At the end of the game, you will get the result, meaning the condition you are after the tasks you've accomplished throughout the day.<br>
The goal is to reach the maximum health level available after accomplishing all of the tasks.
Often, real patients tend to struggle with the responsebilities they are dealing with- keeping an eye on the watch, taking the right amount of medication and so on and so forth.<br>
During the game you will be amazed to find out how much a single person is dealing with every single day.

<p>NOTE: THIS IS A SIMULATION, DO NOT TRY THESE TASKS AT HOME!</p>
